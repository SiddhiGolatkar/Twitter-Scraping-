# Twitter-Scraping-
Using Selenium 

The program should follow these steps:

1. Access the website twitter.com.

2. Scrape all tweets with the hashtags “naukri, jobs, jobseeker, vacancy” from the website, extracting the following information for each tweet:
   
Username: The account name of the user who posted the tweet.
Date and Time: The timestamp indicating when the tweet was posted.
Tweet: The content of the tweet itself.
Mentions: Any usernames mentioned within the tweet.
Hashtags: Any hashtags included in the tweet.
Likes: Number of likes for a tweet.
Retweets: Number of times it has been retweeted.
Comments: Number of comments for a tweet.
Replies: Number of replies for a tweet.
Views: Number of views for a tweet.

3. Clean the extracted data by performing preprocessing tasks on the tweets (e.g., removing special characters, white spaces, stop words, etc.).
   
4. Store the extracted information in a CSV (Comma-Separated Values) file with the following columns:
   
Username: The account name of the user.
Tweet: The content of the tweet.
Date: The date when the tweet was posted.
Time: The time when the tweet was posted.
Mentions: Any usernames mentioned in the tweet.
Hashtags: Any hashtags included in the tweet.
Likes: Number of likes for a tweet.
Retweets: Number of times it has been retweeted.
Comments: Number of comments for a tweet.
Replies: Number of replies for a tweet.
Views: Number of views for a tweet.

5. Once the data is collected and stored, perform analysis on the tweets using appropriate techniques or methods of your choice and generate insights from the same. The analysis could involve tasks such as sentiment analysis, topic modeling, or any other form of analysis that you deem relevant and feasible.
   
Important Note:
Do Not use any paid APIs for this task (such as the Twitter API’s premium or enterprise offerings). The scraping must be performed using open methods.
